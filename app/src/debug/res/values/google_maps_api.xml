    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    ED:C4:2E:C2:3B:34:F5:D9:EF:57:C3:C7:E1:CC:C1:BA:18:FF:F2:7F

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    ED:C4:2E:C2:3B:34:F5:D9:EF:57:C3:C7:E1:CC:C1:BA:18:FF:F2:7F

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
